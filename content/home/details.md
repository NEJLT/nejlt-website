## Details

NEJLT welcomes manuscripts from anywhere in the world that related excellent research in the field of language technology and natural language processing. Work on all languages is welcome. The range of papers suitable for NEJLT is just the same as that suitable at, for example, the ACL conference.

The ACL Anthology has accepted inclusion of articles published in NEJLT, and this will come into effect in 2020.



The journal is published by Link√∂ping University press, for whom we are very grateful. The editor-in-chief of NEJLT is appointed by the North European Association for Language Technology. This geographical connection gives the journal its name, though the journal itself does not have a Northern European language focus.
