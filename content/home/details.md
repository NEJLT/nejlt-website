NEJLT welcomes manuscripts from anywhere in the world that present excellent research in the field of language technology and natural language processing. Work on all languages is welcome. The range of papers suitable for NEJLT is just the same as that suitable at international NLP venues, for example, the ACL conference.

NEJLT is the journal of [NEALT](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nealt/), the Northern European Association for Language Technology.

The ACL Anthology includes articles published in NEJLT since volume 7 (2021), under the venue "[NEJLT](https://aclanthology.org/venues/nejlt/)".

The journal is published by [Link√∂ping University Electronic Press](https://ep.liu.se/en/home.aspx), for which we are grateful. The editor-in-chief of NEJLT is appointed by the Northern European Association for Language Technology. This geographical connection gives the journal its name, though the journal itself does not have a Northern European language focus.
