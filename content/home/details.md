## Details

The Northern European Journal of Language Technology welcomes manuscripts from anywhere in the world on excellent work in the field of language technology and natural language processing. All languages are welcome. The range of papers suitable for NEJLT is just the same as that suitable at, for example, the ACL conference.

The journal is published by Link√∂ping University press, for whom we are very grateful. This geographical connection gives the journal its name, though the journal does not have a Northern European language focus. The editor-in-chief of NEJLT is appointed by the North European Association for Language Technology.
