NEJLT is a journal with high-quality reviewing and papers, where you can send reviews from some top conferences along with your revised papers, and that has no ACL embargo on rejected papers.

Papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle.

Possible cycle outcomes are:

* reject (implicit 12-month embargo at NEJLT) - when there are flaws in core/most contributions;
* major edits - flaws in contributions / missing fundamental parts;
* minor edits (<15% of the content needs to change);
* accept / polish and accept (<1% needs to change)

Reviewing takes seven or more weeks, and there are progress updates along the way. We offer full-blind reviewing; nobody associated with acceptance decisions will see an author name.

Journal extensions of prior work are not welcomed. NEJLT submissions should be completely original work. We try to respect our reviewers' time by asking them to examine and give feedback on work that has not been published before; in return, we hope to provide positive and useful reviews.

The turnaround from first submission to first decision is at least seven weeks.

You can include your prior reviews. The journal will allow submission of recent (<1yr) reviews from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or NeurIPS, in the case of journal articles developed on material rejected from those venues. If authors submit a manuscript with reviews, the original MS and cover letter addressing the reviews must also be supplied, as well as consent for us to verify the reviews with the appropriate conference and for the conference to release the reviews to NEJLT.
