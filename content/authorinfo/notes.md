NEJLT aims for high-quality reviewing and papers. As such, papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle.

Possible cycle outcomes are:

* reject (implicit 12-month embargo at NEJLT) - when there are flaws in core/most contributions;
* major edits - flaws in contributions / missing fundamental parts;
* minor edits (<15% of the content needs to change);
* accept / polish and accept (<1% needs to change)

NEJLT aims for a rapid review cycle. The shortest possible time to a first decision is seven or more weeks, and we will provide a decision within eleven weeks for most manuscripts. There are progress updates along the way, visible via the submission site. <!-- We offer full-blind reviewing; nobody associated with acceptance decisions will see an author name. -->

Journal extensions of prior work are **not** eligible for review. NEJLT submissions should be completely original work. We try to respect our reviewers' time by asking them to examine and give feedback on work that has not been published before; in return, we hope to provide positive and useful reviews.

Submissions must **not** be under review anywhere else for the first three months of review, at the discretion of the submission’s managing editor. Contact us for exemptions.

The paper type indicated at submission will not be included in the final publication. The paper types are there to prompt appropriate reviewing and to enable a broad range of submissions, rather than to pigeonhole research.

The turnaround from first submission to first decision is at least seven weeks.

NEJLT supports sticky reviews: that is, you can include prior reviews of a manuscript with your submission, from some venues. The journal will allow submission of recent (<1yr) reviews from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL, or NeurIPS, in the case of journal articles developed on material rejected from those venues. If authors submit a manuscript with reviews, the original MS and cover letter addressing the reviews must also be supplied, as well as consent for us to verify the reviews with the appropriate conference and for the conference to release the reviews to NEJLT.
