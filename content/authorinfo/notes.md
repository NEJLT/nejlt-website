NEJLT aims for high-quality reviewing and papers. As such, papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle.

Possible cycle outcomes are:

* reject (implicit 12-month embargo at NEJLT) - when there are flaws in core/most contributions;
* major edits - flaws in contributions / missing fundamental parts;
* minor edits (<15% of the content needs to change);
* accept / polish and accept (<1% needs to change)

NEJLT aims for a rapid review cycle. The shortest possible time to a first decision is seven or more weeks, and we will provide a decision within eleven weeks for most manuscripts. There are progress updates along the way, visible via the submission site. 

Journal extensions of prior work are **not** eligible for review. NEJLT submissions should be completely original work. We try to respect our reviewers' time by asking them to examine and give feedback on work that has not been published before; in return, we hope to provide positive and useful reviews.

Submissions must **not** be under peer review anywhere else for the first three months of review at NEJLT, at the discretion of the submission’s managing editor. 

Manuscripts available elsewhere as a preprint (e.g. on arXiv or an author's private web page) are eligible for review at NEJLT and papers under review or publication at NEJLT may be privately published by the authors at any time on any non-peer-reviewed, non-archival venue.

A paper may not be simultaneously under review through ACL Rolling Review and NEJLT. A paper that has or will receive reviews through ACL Rolling Review may not be submitted for review to NEJLT - rather, it should be committed to NEJLT through ACL Rolling Review.

The paper type indicated at submission will not be included in the final publication. The paper types are there to prompt appropriate reviewing and to enable a broad range of submissions, rather than to pigeonhole research.

The turnaround from first submission to first decision is at least seven weeks.
