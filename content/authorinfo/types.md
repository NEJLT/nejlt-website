When submitting a full paper to NEJLT, authors should indicate what type it is, choosing from a pre-defined set. There are two goals of dividing papers into different types. The first is to encourage a broad range of submission types; there is a wide diversity in research in NLP. The second is to make sure that papers are reviewed appropriately, and so the paper type indicated prompts a  review form designed for that type.

Not all scholarship falls neatly into one of these paper types. If your manuscript doesn't fit these categories well, but is otherwise a good fit for NEJLT, please [contact the editor](https://www.nejlt.org/contact/).

The types available at NEJLT from 2020 are:

#### Computationally-aided linguistic analysis

The focus of this paper type is new linguistic insight. It might take the form of an empirical study of some linguistic phenomenon, or of a theoretical result about a linguistically-relevant formal system.

#### NLP engineering experiment paper

This paper type typically matches the bulk of submissions at CL and NLP venues.

#### Reproduction paper

The contribution of a reproduction paper lies in analyses of and in insights into existing methods and problemsâ€”plus the added certainty that comes with validating previous results.

#### Resource paper

Papers in this track present a new language resource. This could be a corpus, but also could be an annotation standard, tool, and so on.

#### Position paper

A position paper presents a challenge to conventional thinking or a futuristic new vision. It could open up a new area or novel technology, propose changes in existing research, or give a new set of ground rules.

#### Survey Paper

A survey paper provides a structured overview of the literature to date on a specific topic that helps the reader understand the kinds of questions being asked about the topic, the various approaches that have been applied, how they relate to each other, and what further research areas they open up. A conference-length survey paper should be about a sufficiently focused topic that it can do this successfully with in the page limits.


The review forms used for each type are given on the [Review Process](/review/#forms) page.
These paper types are originally from [COLING 2018](http://coling2018.org/paper-types/).
