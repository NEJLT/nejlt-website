title="Re-using external reviews"
+++


NEJLT supports "sticky" reviews: that is, you can include prior external reviews of a manuscript with your submission, from some venues. The journal offers accelerated review for articles recently (<1yr) reviewed at top-tier venues, including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL, ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS.

If authors submit a manuscript with prior reviews, two attachments should submitted as well as the revised manuscript: the reviews, and a letter addressing the reviews.
To do this, attach the reviews and cover letter as "Comments to the editor" during submission, and we'll handle the rest.
It is recommended that, for each change or deficiency suggested in the reviews, authors either implement the change or discuss in the cover letter the recommendations and their choice not to implement it.
