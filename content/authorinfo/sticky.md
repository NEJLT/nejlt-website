NEJLT supports "sticky" reviews: that is, you can include prior external reviews of a manuscript with your submission, from some venues. The journal will allow submission of recent (<1yr) reviews from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL, COLING, or NeurIPS, in the case of journal articles developed on material rejected from those venues. 

If authors submit a manuscript with prior reviews, the original MS and cover letter addressing the reviews must also be supplied as "comments to the editor", as well as consent for us to verify the reviews with the appropriate conference and for the conference to release the reviews to NEJLT.

To do this, attach the reviews and cover letter as extra files during submission, and we'll handle the rest.
