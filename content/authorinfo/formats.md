NEJLT welcomes two types of submission: *full papers, and shorter *letters*.

## Full paper
Full papers may be of any length, though we recommend about twelve pages (excluding references). There is no penalty for submitting shorter work and we encourage authors to be concise. If you need more space, it is available, but the longer a manuscript is, the more intense the reviewing will be. 

## Letter
Letters relay a sharp and timely result, methodological note, or comment on the field. These are reviewed more quickly than full papers. Letters may be up to six pages (excluding references).
