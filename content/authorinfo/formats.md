NEJLT welcomes two types of submission: **full papers**, and shorter **letters**.

**Full papers** may be of any length, though we recommend about the same amount of content as a TACL paper. If you need more space, it is available, but the longer a manuscript is, the more intense the reviewing will be. We encourage authors to be concise. Shorter papers are also welcome for highly impactful results.

**Letters** should be up to around 1000 words, and may include 2-3 floats (i.e. tables or figures). These are reviewed more quickly than full papers and designed to relay a sharp and timely result, or a comment on the field.
