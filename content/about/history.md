NEJLT was founded in 2008 around the time that the Northern European Association for Language Technology was chartered, and run for some years as a journal with the same focus as the NODALIDA conference, with many editors-in-chief over that time. The old website is [here](https://www.nejlt.ep.liu.se/index.htm), for historical purposes. 

With the growth of the field of language technology, this scope has since been broadened, making NEJLT an indexed journal, run by an established organisation, that is led by globally-recognised researchers in Language Technology.
