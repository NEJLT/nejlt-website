**Focus**

The main focus of NEJLT is Language Technology, i.e. Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics and related topics, on any natural language. The journal is published in Northern Europe, hence its name. NEJLT is indexed by major publication indexing services, and ranked by many national bibliographic ranking systems, including in the Nordics.


**Why a new journal?**


NLP needs a shift in how it publishes. The current situation is that most publications come through conferences, which experience extreme and acute load with little room for scholarly dialogue or for correcting mistakes - and that journals are either highly exclusive, or slow. In the meantime, we still suffer all the problems outlined in Ken Church’s “[Reviewing the Reviewers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J05-4006.pdf)” published in CL back in 2005. It makes sense to create a journal that is rapid, that is well-tuned to modern publishing in NLP, and is capable of reviewing a diverse range of papers well.

Having journals more available means reducing load on of the community; it serves to give opportunities to the good papers that are otherwise recycled between conference venues. Offering review and publication out of the annual conference cycles also benefits authors, allowing them to publish their work without having to wait - especially important for PhD students - while the extra time available means work can be really finished, instead of rushed - important for reviewers and readers.

Finally, providing new NLP venues as journals instead of conferences reduces travel, with all the benefits that that brings (cost, time, social, environmental). 

NEJLT was re-constructed in over the 2019-2020 editor shift, on the agreement of both outgoing and incoming editors, to attempt to address some of these needs.
