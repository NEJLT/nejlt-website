**Focus**

The main focus of NEJLT is Language Technology, i.e. Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics and related topics, on any natural language. The journal is published in Northern Europe, hence its name. NEJLT is indexed by major publication indexing services, and ranked by many national bibliographic ranking systems, including in the Nordics.


**Associations**

NEJLT is indirectly managed by the [Northern European Association of Language Technology](http://omilia.uio.no/nealt/), the members of which are most also ACL members.

NEJLT is published by Linköping University Electronic Press ([LiU E-Press](https://www.ep.liu.se/index.en.asp)) under an Open Access policy under a generous agreement for which we are extremely grateful.

NEJLT papers will, from 2020, be co-published completely free in the [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/).


**Why a new journal?**

NLP needs a shift in how it publishes. The current situation is that most publications come through conferences, which experience extreme and acute load with little room for scholarly dialogue or for correcting mistakes - and that journals are either highly exclusive, or slow. In the meantime, we still suffer all the problems outlined in Ken Church’s “Reviewing the Reviewers” published in CL in 2005, fourteen years ago. I would like to create a journal that is rapid, that is well-tuned to modern publishing in NLP, and is capable of reviewing a diverse range of papers well.

Having journals more available means reducing load on all of us in the community; it serves to give opportunities up the good papers that are otherwise recycled between conference venues. Offering review and publication out of the annual conference cycles also benefits authors, allowing them to publish their work without having to wait - especially important for PhD students - while the extra time means work can be really finished, instead of rushed - important for reviewers and readers.

Finally, providing new NLP venues as journals instead of conferences reduces travel, with all the benefits that that brings (cost, time, social, environmental).
