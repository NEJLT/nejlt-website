NEJLT publishes excellent research in the field of language technology, i.e. Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and related topics. Research focused on *any* natural language is invited.

NEJLT invites both journal articles and academic letters, and has a multi-iteration reviewing process, where revisions are a possibility.

The reviewing philosophy of the journal is to minimise reviewing biases, through for example triple-blind review, and also to provide constructive, helpful feedback during the review process.

The journal's publisher is located in Northern Europe, hence its name. NEJLT is indexed by many publication indexing services, and ranked by many national bibliographic ranking systems, including in the Nordics.

NEJLT accepts submissions all year round.
