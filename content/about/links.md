Previously, NEJLT has had a different remit, with a sequence of previous editors-in-chief. The proposal for changing the journal into its current form is archived [here](http://tekstlab.uio.no/NEALT/proposal_2019.pdf) for posterity. The previous editors are shown [here](http://omilia.uio.no/nealt/?task=about), as the history of the NEALT board.
