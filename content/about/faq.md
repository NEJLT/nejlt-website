**How long is the reviewing turnaround?**

The quickest time to a first decision is *about seven weeks*. We expect to give a first decision on 99% of papers *within twelve weeks*. Subsequent review rounds after correction will be quicker, as editors and reviewers are already allocated. We appreciate a rapid publication turnaround for good work. There's *no post-acceptance typesetting*, so final publication is quick after an accept decision.

**Are there any publishing costs?**

No, none. There are no reviewing costs either.

**Where is NEJLT indexed?**

NEJLT is currently indexed in the ACL Anthology. Google Scholar indexes the journal and its articles. All articles receive a global DOI. NEJLT is also indexed in ResearchGate, DIVA, UFM, and NSD. Applications to Web of Science/Clarivate JCR, to Elsevier/SJR, and to DBLP, are in preparation; the majority of criteria are fulfilled for all these.

**Why Northern Europe?**

NEJLT is a global journal with no specific regional focus. It is hosted by a publisher who donate their technical effort and expertise to keeping the journal running, so we can focus on the research. This publisher, [Link√∂ping e-Press](https://liu.se/en/article/epress), is based in Sweden which lies in north Europe, and the region was incorporated in the name when the journal was started. Thus, for historical reasons, the journal name is prefixed with Northern Europe, even though we have a global focus.
