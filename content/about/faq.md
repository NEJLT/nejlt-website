• **How long is the reviewing turnaround?**

The quickest time to a first decision is *about seven weeks*. We expect to give a first decision on 90% of papers *within twelve weeks*. Subsequent review rounds after correction will be quicker, as editors and reviewers are already allocated. We appreciate a rapid publication turnaround for good work.

• **How long does publication take?**

There's *no post-acceptance typesetting*, so once the camera ready version is submitted after acceptance, final publication is quick. NEJLT is an online-first journal.

• **Are there any publishing costs?**

No, none. There are no submission or review costs either.

• **Where is NEJLT indexed?**

Google Scholar indexes the journal and its articles. All articles receive a global DOI. NEJLT is currently indexed in the ACL Anthology. NEJLT is also indexed in ResearchGate, DIVA, UFM, and NSD. We are specifically targetting applications to Scopus and Elsevier/SJR, as soon as the requirements are fulfilled. Applications are in preparation to Web of Science/Clarivate JCR, DBLP, and DOAJ. The majority of criteria are already fulfilled for all of these.

• **Why is "Northern Europe" in the title?**

NEJLT is a global journal with no specific regional focus. It is maintained by the [Northern European Association for Language Technology](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nealt/) and published by [Linköping University Electronic Press](https://ep.liu.se/en/), both of which are based in Northern Europe, and the region was incorporated in the name when the journal was started. Thus, for historical reasons, the journal name is prefixed with Northern Europe, even though we have a global focus.
<!-- It is hosted by a publisher who donate their technical effort and expertise to keeping the journal running, so we can focus on the research. -->

• **Where do the journal issue cover images come from?**

Cover images related scenes of relevance to Northern Europe. If you have a suggestion for a cover for a future issue, mail it to us - [editors@nejlt.org](editors@nejlt.org)!
