NEJLT is, through a board position, managed by the [Northern European Association of Language Technology](http://omilia.uio.no/nealt/). Specifically, this free-to-join association elects the editor-in-chief every two years.

NEJLT is published by Link√∂ping University Electronic Press ([LiU E-Press](https://www.ep.liu.se/index.en.asp)) under an Open Access policy through a mutual agreement for which we are very grateful.

NEJLT papers will, from 2020, be co-published in the [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/) free.
