Author identity should be hidden from those reviewing NEJLT manuscripts. This is achieved through accepting only anonymised submissions, and obscuring author identity during review.

Anonymous review can impose unreasonable constraints on resource-type papers, and so in this case, anonymisation requirements are relaxed slightly; there need be no "undignified mental gymnastics" in describing work on language resources that one has done. The goal is to protect, and not to punish, the author. However, a reasonable effort should be make to conceal names of authors from reviewers who may be unfamiliar with the resource or its context, including e.g. hiding some URLs, keeping author names off the title page, and avoiding referring previous work with pronouns like "my" or "our".
