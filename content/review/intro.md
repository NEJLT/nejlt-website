At NEJLT, the review process has the following top-level steps.

* An anonymised article is submitted for review in the journal template.
* Editors are assigned to manage contact with the authors, and the review process.
* Expert reviewers are found, to submit their reviews.
* Once all reviews are in, a decision is made on the article.
* Depending on the outcome, the article is published, sent for revisions, or rejected.

The process is explained in detail below, as well as how NEJLT manages anonymity.
