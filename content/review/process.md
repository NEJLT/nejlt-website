Submissions are assigned a managing editor (ME), who desk-checks and deals with author contact, and allocates an action editor (AE) to make the decision and to find reviewers.

Papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle. Possible cycle outcomes are:

* accept 
	* accept the paper as-is
	* invite for camera ready
	* paper goes to publication
* polish+accept
	* < 2% of the content needs change
	* invite for camera ready
	* AE or ME will check changes have been implemented
	* paper goes to publication
* minor edits
	* < 15% of the content needs change
	* revision is invited
	* at AE discretion, there may be some further external review
* major edits
	* flaws in some contributions or some core questions are not answered
	* revision is invited
	* the next round will be full external review
* reject 
	* when there are crucial flaws in core contributions or multiple contributions
	* 12-month embargo at NEJLT
	* there won't be another round of review


Sometimes a manuscript is not eligible for review and has to be rejected before this step. This is called a desk reject. Desk rejects should be quick. These will be issued for manuscripts that are clearly out of scope; that are much below the required quality standard; that are duplicates or plagiarised; or that openly reveal author names. These are generally unfortunate for both authors and editors to deal with, and we would prefer not to send any desk rejects, so please read the guidelines before submitting a paper; contact us if you are in doubt.

Prior reviews from some venues may be submitted with a manuscript. These may be considered by AEs for the first decision, and are released to reviewers only _after_ the first round of reviewing. This is to avoid biasing our reviewers’ initial impression and thus compromising review quality. Consent is requested during manuscript submission to verify reviews with the original venue.

NEJLT recruits reviewers from the global NLP community and from reviewers who have previously been responsive and thorough.
We expect AEs to be responsive; in return, we limit their load, and will find new AEs if manuscript load increases. The journal should have as much transparency as possible: this means notifying authors as manuscripts move through the pipeline.

Camera ready submissions are typically assigned a DOI and published within seven days of receipt. We expect NEJLT ingestion requests to be sent to the ACL Anthology about twice a year, so published articles should appear in the Anthology within six months.

Time to first decision, for NEJLT in 2022:

- median: 69 days
- mean: 87 days
- s.d.: 39.7

 This covers manuscripts submitted in 2022, that ended in an accept decision. For comparison, published time from submission to decision at EMNLP 2022 was 105 days.
