Submissions are assigned a managing editor (ME), who desk-checks and deals with author contact, and allocates an action editor (AE) to make the decision and to find reviewers.

Papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle. Possible cycle outcomes are:

* reject (implicit 12-month embargo at NEJLT) - when there are flaws in core/most contribs;
* major edits - flaws in contribs / missing fundamental parts;
* minor edits (<15% of the content needs to change);
* accept / polish+accept (<1% needs to change)

We maintain a large standing pool of reviewers, drawn from the NEALT community and from invitations to those who have reviewed responsively for the field in the past. We expect AEs to be responsive; in return, we limit their load, and will find new AEs if manuscript load increases. The journal should have as much transparency as possible: this means notifying authors when things happen. 

We give a minimum reviewing time of about seven weeks, if everything runs perfectly. From 2020, the intended process, after receiving a submission, is:

* allocate managing editor 
* ME filters for desk reject, using BMJ procedures as guidelines if needed 
* ME checks paper type and if needed talks with authors about this
* ME waits for an available AE 
* ME allocates AE and passes on anonymised reviews to AE, if given
* AE accepts 
* AE finds reviewers, keeping the manuscript anonymised 
* We receive 2 reviews in 1 month 
* AE finds additional review(s) in 3w, if needed
* AE writes meta-review on all reviews available, revealing (if supplied) past reviews to other reviewers 
* ME contacts authors with outcome 
* Authors given fixed window to revise (15 weeks for major/minor revisions; no fixed window for accepts)

The way that prior reviews are used is that they may be considered by AEs for the first decision, and are released to reviewers only after the first round of reviewing (details below). This is to avoid biasing our reviewers’ initial impression and thus compromising our quality.

Desk rejects should be quick. These will be issued for manuscripts that are clearly out of scope; that are much below the required quality standard; that are duplicates or plagiarised; or that openly reveal author names. These are generally unpleasant to deal with, and we would prefer not to send any, so please read the guidelines before submitting anything, and contact us if you are in doubt.
