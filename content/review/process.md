Submissions are assigned a managing editor (ME), who desk-checks and deals with author contact, and allocates an action editor (AE) to make the decision and to find reviewers.

Papers must reach “minor edits” by the end of the 2nd review cycle. Possible cycle outcomes are:

* reject (implicit 12-month embargo at NEJLT) - when there are flaws in core contributions or multiple contributions;
* major edits - flaws in some contributions or some core questions are unanswered;
* minor edits (<15% of the content needs change);
* accept / polish+accept (<1% of the content needs change)

NEJLT maintains a large standing pool of reviewers, drawn from the global NLP community and from invitations to those who have reviewed responsively for the field in the past. We expect AEs to be responsive; in return, we limit their load, and will find new AEs if manuscript load increases. The journal should have as much transparency as possible: this means notifying authors as manuscripts move through the pipeline.

We give an estimated _minimum_ reviewing time of about seven weeks, if everything runs perfectly. <!-- From 2020, the intended process, after receiving a submission, is:

* Allocate managing editor
* ME filters for desk reject, using BMJ procedures as guidelines if needed
* ME checks paper type and if needed talks with authors about this
* ME waits for an available AE
* ME allocates AE and passes on anonymised reviews to AE, if given
* AE accepts
* AE finds reviewers, keeping the manuscript anonymised
* Two reviews are received over the next month
* AE finds additional review(s), if needed
* AE writes meta-review on all reviews available, revealing (if supplied) past reviews to other reviewers
* ME contacts authors with outcome
* Authors given fixed window to revise (15 weeks for major/minor revisions; no fixed window for accepts) -->

Prior reviews from some venues may be submitted with a manuscript. These may be considered by AEs for the first decision, and are released to reviewers only _after_ the first round of reviewing. This is to avoid biasing our reviewers’ initial impression and thus compromising review quality. Consent is requested during manuscript submission to verify reviews with the original venue.

Sometimes a manuscript is not eligible for review and has to be rejected before this step. This is called a desk reject. Desk rejects should be quick. These will be issued for manuscripts that are clearly out of scope; that are much below the required quality standard; that are duplicates or plagiarised; or that openly reveal author names. These are generally unfortunate for both authors and editors to deal with, and we would prefer not to send any desk rejects, so please read the guidelines before submitting a paper; contact us if you are in doubt.
