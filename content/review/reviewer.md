While during reviewing authors and other reviewers will have their identities concealed from each other, NEJLT adopts an open policy later in the decision process. After reviewing is done, reviewer names may be revealed both to other reviewers and also to authors. This follows indications that malicious reviews are less prevalent when reviewer identity may be revealed. 

At NEJLT, we hope to foster constructive dialogue between authors and experts in the field, and remove the shields of anonymity is a step towards improving that dialogue, especially important in a field such as computer science where reviewing can be [hypercritical](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/134743-yes-computer-scientists-are-hypercritical/fulltext). Revealing reviewer identity serves to improve review tone, while also removing biases during reviewer discussions.
