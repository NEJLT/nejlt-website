Author identity should be hidden from anyone responsible for the decision on an NEJLT manuscript. This is achieved through accepting only blind submissions, and obscuring author identity from reviewers and action editors. A separate managing editor handles contact with the authors where necessary. This is **triple-blind reviewing**.

This is based on both peer-reviewed research revealing a number of biases in academic review when [facts about authors are revealed](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12349), and also [experience](https://coling2018.org/untangling-biases-and-nuances-in-double-blind-peer-review-at-scale/) with blind and non-blind area chairing.

Triple-blind can impose unreasonable constraints on resource-type papers, and so in this case, blinding requirements are relaxed a bit; there need be no "undignified mental gymnastics" in describing work on language resources that one has done. The goal is to protect, and not to punish, the author. However, a reasonable effort should be make to conceal names of authors from reviewers who may be unfamiliar with the resource or its context, including e.g. hiding some URLs, keeping author names off the title page, and avoiding referring previous work with pronouns like "my" or "our".
