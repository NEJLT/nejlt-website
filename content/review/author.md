Author identity should be hidden from anyone responsible for the decision on an NEJLT manuscript. This is achieved through accepting only blind submissions, and obscuring author identity from reviewers and action editors. A separate managing editor handles contact with the authors where necessary. This is **triple-blind reviewing**.

This is based on both peer-reviewed research revealing a number of biases in academic review when [facts about authors are revealed](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12349), and also [experience](https://coling2018.org/untangling-biases-and-nuances-in-double-blind-peer-review-at-scale/) with blind and non-blind area chairing.

This imposes some constraints on resource papers, which are to be relaxed a bit; there need be no "undignified mental gymnastics" in describing work on language resources that one has done. The goal is to protect, and not to punish, the author.
