NEJLT offers a high degree of blinding during review. This means it is possible for sitting board members to be co-authors on submissions. However, the following rules apply:

* No person with a conflict-of-interest with an author may have influence over or observe the decision making process for that author's submissions.
* The sitting EiC may not be listed as an author on any submissions.
* No editor aside from the managing editor, action editor, and editor-in-chief may be privy to deliberations around a manuscript.

NEJLT follows TACL in using the definition of conflict-of-interest (COI) set forth by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), namely, a person has a COI with a submitted paper if that person:

1. is a co-author of the paper; or
1. has been a student or supervisor of one of the authors in the previous five years; or 
1. has co-authored a paper or collaborated with one of the authors in the previous five years; or 
1. is employed at the same company or institution as an author; or 
1. has any other circumstances that could cause a bias in evaluating the paper.
