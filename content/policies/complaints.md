Complaints are in the first instance to be sent to the editor in chief, or the editorial office, using the email addresses on the NEJLT contact page.
Complaints about the NEJLT editor-in-chief can be sent to members of the [NEALT executive board](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nealt/index.php/contact/).

NEJLT will acknowledge the complaint as soon as possible and progress the case with weekly updates, aiming for a resolution within six weeks of receipt.

NEJLT may refer concerns of a harassing, offensive, threatening, or defamatory manner to legal counsel or other appropriate authorities. Complaints made in such language will not be investigated.

If the investigation finds that the concern is valid, follow the appropriate COPE guidance for dealing with the issue.

The correspondent’s right to anonymity is respected, and their identity will not be revealed to the party facing concerns without the correspondent’s explicit permission.

When the investigation is closed, the complainant will be informed of the action NEJLT takes. 

NEJLT defers to the recommended [COPE processes on complaint handling](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/research-integrity-concerns).
