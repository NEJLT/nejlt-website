title="Data Sharing and Intellectual Property"
+++

NEJLT mediates no data sharing and does not mandate data sharing or reproducibility of submitted papers. However, reviewers made give submitted works decreased scores if they fail to share data or reproducible code where relevant, which may lead to paper rejection.

NEJLT does not give any awards to papers where relevant code and data are not publicly available, accessible, and reproducible.

Authors retain full ownership of their papers and the intellectual property therein during the entire review and publication process. Submissions that infringe on others intellectual property rights are not welcome, and may be desk rejected or withdrawn from publication at any time without prior consultation.
