title="Data Sharing and Reproducibility"
+++

NEJLT mediates no data sharing and does not mandate data sharing or reproducibility of submitted papers. However, reviewers made give submitted works decreased scores if they fail to share data or reproducible code where relevant, which may lead to paper rejection.

NEJLT does not give any awards to papers where relevant code and data are not publicly available, accessible, and reproducible.
