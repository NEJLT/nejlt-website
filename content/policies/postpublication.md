Authors of published works may request retraction of or minor updates to their articles. NEJLT expects to process these within two weeks. In case of a larger update (alterations to the finding or results of the paper that affect the conclusions, or an edit of more than 3% of the text), the action editor of the paper will decide whether re-review is needed, or if the update can be made without review.
