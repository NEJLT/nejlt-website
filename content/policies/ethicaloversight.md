__Policy on consent to publication__

All persons named in a publication must be aware of the publication's existence and have consented to their name being used in connection with the publication. This includes offering them a copy of the final manuscript (minus other people's names) to review, so that they can give informed consent over what they are being named in.

__Policy on research on vulnerable populations__

Research on vulnerable populations is in general only welcome at NEJLT if a member of that population has been included in the design and conduct of the research in an authoritative position, and also receives prominent placement in the authorship list, commensurate with their contribution. Research on vulnerable populations that was not conducted in collaboration with researcher from those populations should not be submitted to NEJLT.

__Policy on ethical conduct of research using animals__

Research using animals is not welcome at NEJLT.

__Policy on ethical conduct of research using human subjects__

Research using human subjects is only welcome at NEJLT if they have given informed consent to being used in the study, and are demonstrably compensated for their work at the rate of the living wage in the researcher's country or higher. Please retain documentation of this payment rate in case the editors ask for it.

__Policy on handling confidential data__

Confidential data -- except author names and affiliations -- must not be submitted to NEJLT and will not knowingly be published or publishable at NEJLT. In GDPR terms, "confidential data" can be interpreted as Sensitive Personal Data.

__Overseeing authority__

NEJLT operates under the Northern European Association for Language Technology, [NEALT](https://tekstlab.uio.no/nealt/).
