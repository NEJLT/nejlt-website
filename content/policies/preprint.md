NEJLT adopts a light anonymity policy. We ask that authors do not publish or promote preprints of the work during the review period, i.e. from the time of submission.

The notion of *preprint* is understood broadly to refer to any non-refereed paper posted online, including but not limited to preprint servers such as arXiv. Note that the rule applies only to preprints that authors post themselves, so it does not apply to (say) non-refereed proceedings volumes. The restriction on updating is to prevent authors from circumventing these rules by "flag planting" with a placeholder version over 1 month in advance.

Submissions that are deposited to institutional registries as a process requirement, e.g. for the submission of documents in partial fulfilment of a qualification, are exempt from this policy at NEJLT, as long as at least one author's affiliation matches the affiliation of the registry. ArXiv, and similar sites where author affiliation is not necessarily linked to the repository owner, are not considered institutional registries.

In exchange for asking that author identities are not published during the review period, NEJLT endeavours to provide a rapid but diligent process. Evidence indicates that knowing a paper comes from a prestigious source distorts reviews, both in [computer science](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12708?collection=) and in [other fields](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2556112). In-process anonymity should reduce, or at least not amplify, this effect.
